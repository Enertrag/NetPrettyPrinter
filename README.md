# NetPrettyPrinter

This is an implementation of the pretty printing algorithm by Derek C. Oppen (https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/derek-oppen/prettyprinting.pdf) obtained by a port of the Python code of oppen-pretty-printer (https://libraries.io/pypi/oppen-pretty-printer) to C#/.NET Framework 4 with a combinator frontend inspired by Phil Wadler's prettier printer (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf) and the Hughes/Peyton Jones pretty printer of the GHC library (https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/pretty-1.1.3.6/Text-PrettyPrint-HughesPJ.html) but without any proven algebaric properties or derivations.
